# Assignment Ch. 4 - Machine Learning and Deep Learning (Startup Campus) 🚀✨

## Target Portfolio 📑
* I could do data segmentation using clustering method
* I could use and compare some supervised learning models
* I could design and create a simple neural network with perceptron model using MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset

## Case #1: “Churn Status in Banking” 🪲
* Dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rietaros/kampus_merdeka/main/SC_HW1_bank_data.csv
* Task: Compare  3 model evaluations, and summarize which model is the best. For this assignments, I used Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Classifier models. The best accuracy goes to SVM with the accuracy: 86.4%.

## Case #2: "Random Points" 🐞
* Dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rietaros/kampus_merdeka/main/cluster_s1.csv 
* Task: Summarize how many clusters are the best for the data using Clustering Optimization Methods (Elbow Method, Silhouette Score Comparison, etc.). Also visualize the cluster

## Case #3: "Deep Learning for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification" 🪲
* Task:
  * Design neural network model for MNIST dataset.
  * Setup some hyperparameters such as Loss Function, Optimizer, Learning Rate, etc
  * Develop a training loop and run a training model
  * Evaluate the Model using several performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, etc.
* The accuracy: 92.03%
